# Daily Changelog Generator

This workflow helps you create a changelog for your daily work.

1.  **Check your recent git commits:**
    I will run the following command to see your commits from today.
    ```bash
    git log --author="$(git config user.name)" --since="yesterday" --oneline
    ```

2.  **Summarize your work:**
    I will present the commits to you and ask for a summary of your changes to be added to the `changelog.md` file.

3.  **Create/Append to daily changelog:**
    I will append to the `changelog.md` file. The content will include a header with the current date, the list of commits, and your summary.
